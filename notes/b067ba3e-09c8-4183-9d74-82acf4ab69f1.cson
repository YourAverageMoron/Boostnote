  # Variance and Standard Deviation 
  
  ## Population Variance
  
  ###### Definition
  Variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean.
  
  ###### Explanation
  This is essintialy the avarage squared distance of the population from the population's mean.

  - **σ²** = The Variance
  - **x**  = Each individal data point in the population
  - **μ**  = The mean of the population
  - **N**  = The number of items in the population
  
  ###### Other Formulas
  You can expand the squared bracket and simplify, this prduces this alternate formula:

  ## Population Standard Deviation
  
  ###### Definition
  A quantity expressing by how much the members of a group differ from the mean value for the group.
  
  ###### Explanation
  This is the square root of the variance.
  It's symbol is **σ**.
  
  _**Remember** - Always consider variance in relation to the mean_
