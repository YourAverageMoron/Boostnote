  # Regression to the mean
  Following an extreme even, the next random event is likely to be less extreme. Note this is not the gamblerâ€™s fallacy.
  
  I.e this leads to the law of large numbers as the more attempts you take the closer to the mean you will get.
  
  ###### Example
  If you toss a coin 10 times and get 10 heads.
  If you then toss the coin 10 more times you expect to get less than 10 heads:
  - Expected would be 5
  So in the 20 spins the expected mean would be closer to 50% heads than to  to the original 100% estimate from 10 tosses.
