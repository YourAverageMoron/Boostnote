  # Introduction to Intelligent Agents
  ## Motivation for using agents
  Agents can help solve some difficult problems
  
  They allow you to easily simulate different scenarios only by creating agents that mimic the different actors that work in a given environment
  
  ### But they also create new problems:
  - Independent action -> responsibility
    - Whose responsibility?
    - For what?
  - How to engineer reliable multi agent systems?
  - It's a new paradigm for software engineers
  - How do we handle software that can cooperate, coordinate, negotiate, adapt, and argue
  
  ### Where would you use agents?
  - In environments that change unpredictably
  - Where there are limited resources or resources with changing availablity
  - Where you need resilience
    - Known-unknowns
    - Even some unknown-unknowns
  - Decentralized/No overall control: autonomous actors

  ## Agent characteristics
  ### What is an agent?
  An intelligent agent is a computer system capable of flexable, **autonomous** action in some environment

  ### What are multi-agent systems?
  An agent can be more useful in the context of others:
  - Can **concentrate** on tasks within competence
  - Can **delegate** other tasks
  - Can use the ability to **communicate**, **coordinate**, and **negotiate**
  - Howeve they lack organisation
  ![90843436.png](:storage\\6a4c985a-b57e-4ca2-8463-47437811f874\\90843436.png =400x)
  
  ### Reactive
  > Agents continuously interract with the environment and respond to changes
  
  Fixed programs execute blindly and there is no success or failure
  However the real in the real world the environment often changes or is incomplete which means that if you execute the same thing twice it is unlikely that you will get the same result
  
  Reactive systems interact continuously with the environment and respond to any changes
  
  ### Pro-active
  > Agents will generate goals and attempt to achieve them
  
  Goal directed behaviour often requires AI techniques (e.g reasoning with rules)
  
  Pro-active systems **generate** and **achive** (or **maintain**) goals:
  - This isn't just driven by events
  - The agent will take the initiative
  - Recognises opportunaties
  
  The agent needs an environment model for decision-making:
  - Knowledge-driven (classical AI, logic, rules)
  - Data-driven (neural networks, time series, Markov decision process)
  
  ### Social ability
  > Agents will interact with each other (even humans), using an agent-communication language, in order to achieve goals
  
  The real world is a multiagent environment where the actor cannot achieve goals without taking into account others
  
  Some goals requre cooperation:
  - Information/models of othere agents' state
  - Trust metrics
  - Reputation models
  - Communication language
  - Common domain of discourse
  - Capacity to reach agreements
  - Capacity for (bounded) rational reasoning
  
  ### Minor agent characteristics
  
  #### Mobility
  Can move around in a (computer) network
  
  #### Veracity
  Will an agent intentionally communicate false information?
  
  #### Benevolence
  If agents have conflicting goals, will they help each other?
  
  #### Rationality
  Will an agent to achieve its goals, and not deliberately act to prevent their achievement?
  
  #### Learning/adaption
  Will an agent get better over time
  Some times we don't want this
  
  ### Difference between agents and objects
  #### Objects
  - Encapsulate some state
  - Communicates via message passing
  - Has methods which operate on the objects state
  - Objects do what they are told
  
  #### Agents
  - Are **autonomous** and have an internal decision procedure which determines whether or not to perfor an action on request
  - Are **smart** and capable of flexable (reactive, proactive and social) behaviour
  - Are **active** and a multiagent system is a set of processes
  - Are **benevolent** and act because they want to do so
  - Are **utilitarian** as they act in order to gain something
  
  ### Difference between agents and expert systems
  Expert systems contain 'expertise' about some topic
  #### Difference
  - Agents are situated where expert systems are not
  - Expert systems obtain information from asking the user questions where agents do not
  - Agents act where expert system do not
  
  Some real time (typically process control) expert systems are agents
  
  Expert systems are useful **components** of agents

  ## Environment of agents
  Agents act within environments, the characteristics of these environemnts can make it harder for agents to act in them
  
  ### Accessible vs inaccessible
  Accessible environments have complete, accurate, and up-to-date information about the state of the environment
  
  Inaccessible environments are often harder to work with
  
  ### Deterministic vs non-deterministic
  In a deterministic environment any single action has a guarenteed effect
  There is no uncertainty about the resulting state
  
  Non-deterministic environments are generally harder to work with
  
  ### Static vs dynamic
  In a static environment only the actions of the agents will change the environment
  
  Dynamic environments are generally harder to work with
  
  ### Episodic vs non-episodic
  Episodic environments have several, independent, discrete episodes
  The action choice depends on the current episode 
  
  Non-episodic environments are generally harder to work with
  
  ### Discrete vs continuous
  Discrete environments have a fixed, finite number of actions and percepts
  
  Continuous environments have an unknown number of actions and percepts
  
  Continuous environments are generally harder to work with

  ## Agents as intentional systems
  > An intentional system is used to describe entities whose behaviour can be predicted by attributing beliefs, desires and rational capability
  
  It is the basis for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model of agency
  
  ### Levels of intentional system
  #### First order
  Beliefs and desires, but no beliefs and desires about beliefs and desires...
  
  #### Second order
  Beliefs and desires (and other intentional states) about beliefs and desires (and other intentional states) - of others itself
  
  ### Abstractions
  Abstractions replace detail with a single concept
  The more complex a system is the more levels of absraction that are needed
  
  Agents, and agents as intentional systems are just an abstraction
