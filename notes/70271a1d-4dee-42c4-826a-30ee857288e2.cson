  # CSS 3
  ## Overview
  This is just a newer version of CSS, and adds some extra features by extending on CSS 2.1.
  Extra features include:
  -- Rounded Corners
  -- Shadows
  -- Gradients
  -- Transitions
  -- Animations
  -- Updated layouts such as flex box and multi columns
  
  _**Note:** Not all browsers support CSS 3 and it also includes some experimental parts that shouldnâ€™t be used in production environments._

  ## Transitions
  The transition property is a shorthand property used to represent up to four transition-related longhand properties:
  -- **transition-property:** The CSS property that the transition effect is for.
  -- **transition-duration:** The time taken in seconds for the transition to occur.
  -- **transition-timing-function:** The speed curve of the transition effect, there are a couple of built in options but you can set up your own.
  -- **transition-delay:** The delay time in seconds that will occur before starting the transition.

  ## Transform
  This applies to the 2D or 3D transformation of an element. It allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, e.t.c elements.
  #### Using Transition and Transform Example
  ```
  img {
  	Transition: all 1s;
  }
  
  img:hover: {
  	transform : scale(1.1);
  }
  ```
  This will scale images to 1.1 times their original size when the image is hovered over, it will take 1 second to do this.

  ## Animations
  //TODO fill this part in with the animation stuff you can do in css

  ## Browser Support
  Some of the CSS3 features are not supported on some browsers.
  
  Sometimes you may have to add a browser prefix for some browsers that do not yet support the feature.
