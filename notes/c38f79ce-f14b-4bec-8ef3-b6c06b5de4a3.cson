  # Internet Protocol Hardware
  ## Ethernet
  - Ethernet arose in 1982, based on an earlier Aloha protocol
  - It used carrier ende, multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD)
  - It origionally had a 10Mb/s signalling rate
    - The rate of delivery of bits across the physical network
    - Due to the layering encapsulation and other physical overheads, this was not the delivery rate when the application was running
    - However the lower rate is not the one that marketers use
      - E.g a 54Mb/s Wi-Fi network might only deliver half that value to an application
  - The Ethernet standard covers both the PHY and the MAC layers
  
  ### Ethernet frames
  **An Ethernet frame:**
  ![c2578bb9.png](:storage\\c38f79ce-f14b-4bec-8ef3-b6c06b5de4a3\\c2578bb9.png)
  
  The numbers are the byte counts:
  - Destination address: 6 bytes
  - Type: 2 bytes
    - Indicates what kind of (network layer) data follows (e.g hex 0800 for an IP packet)
  - Data: 
    - Minimum of 46 bytes, the data must be padded with extra bytes if fewer than 46 bytes are supplied
      - A higher layer must detect and remove padding when necessary
    - Maximum of 1500 bytes 
  - Checksum: 4 bytes
    - Cyclic redundancy check (CRC)
    - Used to check for corruption errors in the frame
  - (Origionally) Ethernet is shared, so every host sees every frame on the local network
  - Every Ethernet card a unique address built into it
    - _Not completely true, but it gives a good enough idea what is going on_
  - The destination address allows the Ethernet card in a host to recognise that a frame was sent to it, it can then read and process the frame
  - This creates a security issue
    - The source address allows a host to determine who sent the frame so it can reply of needed
  - If the address is no-local we cant just use a 6 byte address to locate a destination
    - This is handled by the IP layer
  
  ### Ethernet CSMA/CD
  - Ethernet is a multi access (shared) medium
    - Several hosts use the same piece of wire to send data to one another
  
  ![b9b41d92.png](:storage\\c38f79ce-f14b-4bec-8ef3-b6c06b5de4a3\\b9b41d92.png)
  
  - **Carrier sense**
    - Suppose A wishes to send to B:
      - If C is already sending to D, the whole network is occupied with its signal
      - This means that A must wait
    - If two hosts try to send simultaniously there will be a collision
    - This is an actual physical condition where the electrical signal from th etwo hosts get mixed and thus corrupted
    - So before they send data a host listens to the Ethernet to see if anyone else is using it at the moment
    - If nobody is already using the Ethernet it will send the data
      - Otherwise it must wait until the carrier is free
  
  This isnt quite enough:
  ![7aadea0f.png](:storage\\c38f79ce-f14b-4bec-8ef3-b6c06b5de4a3\\7aadea0f.png)
  
  - **Collision detection**
    - Each host continues to listen while transmitting to make sure there are no collisions
    - If a collision is detected each host stops transmitting, waits a (small) random period of time and retries with the carrier sense
    - The random wait means that another collision is less likely as one host will come in slighly later and see that the other's signal in its carrier sense phase
    - Detecting collisions on an Ethernet is simple:
      - If you are on the network and you see signals that are different to the ones that you are putting out, this means that someone else is transmitting too
  
  ![8911b80c.png](:storage\\c38f79ce-f14b-4bec-8ef3-b6c06b5de4a3\\8911b80c.png)
  
  - Collision detection is why there is a minimum frame size
  - The frames must be on the wire long enough for the hardware to detect a collision
  - The speed of the signal in the wire is the problem here:
    - And this gets workse with faster Ethernets
  
  ### Physical ethernet
  There have been many Ethernet physical layers
  |Standard |Cable       |Max Size|Rate   |

  - The cabes used in the se PHYs change over time
  - Unshielded twisted pairs (UTP) comes in various qualities;
    - Category 1: No performance criteria
    - Category 2: Rated to 1MHz
      - Used for telephone wiring
    - Category 3: Rated to 16MHz 
      - Used for wthernet 10BaseT
    - Category 4: Rated to 20MHz
      - Used for token-ring 10BaseT
    - Category 5: Rated to 100Mhz
      - Used for 1000baseT, 100BaseT and 10Base10
    - Category 5e (enhanced): Rated at 100MHz
      - Has better cross talk specification than 5
      - Used for 2.5GBaseT and 1000BaseT
    - Category 6: Rated to 200MHz 
      - Used for 5GbaseT and 10GBaseT up to 55m
    - Category 6a (argumented): Rated to 500MHz
      - Has extra crosstalk shielding
      - Used for 10GBaseT up to 100m
  - Cat 5e and Cat 6 are most widely used today
    - They are roughtly the same price
    - Cat 6a are a lot more expensive
  - When creating new Ethernet standards we have to make sure it wont require us to replace the old cabling

  - Twisted pair uses hubs or switches
  - Hubs are simple electrical repeaters
    - An incoming signal is sent out on all outputs
    - There is a single collision domain as all hosts see all signals
      - Any pair of signals between hosts will collide
    - The available bandwidth is shared amongst all the hosts
  - A switch understands the link layer
    - It only sends the signal out on the single wire that has the diestination host
    - This requires the swich to read and understand the MAC addresses in the frames and to track the socket where each host is plugged in
    - This is extra complexity in the switch hardware
    - It reduces the number of possible collisions
      - Which increases throughput
    - The full bandwidth is available on each output simultaneosly
    - Collision only if two hosts send to the same destination simuntaneously
    - If an output is busy, rather than have a collision a switch may choose to store and forward the packet later when the output is free
      - However buffers in the switch can fill up and then packets would have to be dropped by the switch
      - So the switch can send a jamming signal on an input to get it to back off and resend it later
    - Some switches can cut through, sending the start of the packet before the tail has arrived
      - This leads to less latency through the switch
      - It does forward corrupted packets that the "store and forward" method would discard
    - Switches can run in full duplex
      - With independent inward and outward traffic to each host
      - This gives twice the total bandwidth
      - No collisions are possible between opposing traffic as inward and outward traffic runs over different twisted pairs (below 1Gb)

  #### Faster Ethernet
  - Ethernet is moving faster
    - 10Mb/s to 1Gb/s and more, all using the same basic CSMA/CD protocol
      - But they use differeing electical signaling
  - Ethernet cards can autonegotiate to select optimim speed
  - It's not just a case of increasing the frequency of the signal
    - There are other complications to get around the limitations of the cables
  - 1Gb/s Ethernet is everywhere, while 10Gb/s Etherent is currently gaining popularity
  - These faster rates are mostly optical fibre
    - But 40Gb/s can run over Cat8 twisted pair
  
  #### Physical encodings of bits on a 10MB/s Ethernet
  - A simple 0V for 0 and 1V for 1, running at 10MHz:
    - This has a number of problems
    - An empty network and a stream of 0s look the same
      - You would not be able to use carrier sense
    - Bits need to be synchronised to prevent drifting out of step
      - Was that 1000 or 999 0s?
    - A long stream of 1s is a steady 1v
      - This is electrically a bad design
      - An average 0V is best
      - To connect devices easily you need an AC signal, not a DC one
  - Insead Ethernet uses Manchester Encoding:
    - Split the time interval for a bit into two parts
    - Low then high voltage as a 0
    - High then low voltage is a 1
    - This creates an average of 0V
    - -0.85V for low
    - +0.85V for high
    - Easy to synchronise
      - Transit through 0V is the middle of the bit
    - This does double the frequency of the signal to 20MHz
    - We can use Cat 4 (or better) cables for this
    - It is self clocking
      - The reading end does not need a clock to determine where the bits are
  
  #### Physical encodings of bits on a 100MB/s Ethernet
  - We cant use Cat 5 cables with Manchester as it is only specified to 100MHz, and we would need 200Mhz
  -  Instead we start encoding data bits as 5 physical bits in a 4B/5B encoding
  -  This is done using a dictionary that maps 4 bits to 5 bits
  
  ![ebfdaf0c.png](:storage\\c38f79ce-f14b-4bec-8ef3-b6c06b5de4a3\\ebfdaf0c.png)
  
  - This allows for a three level physical encoding MLT-3
    - This has +, 0 and - levels (Â±0.85V)
    - Again using transitions to encode bits
  - Transitions are cyclical
    - - to 0
    - 0 to +
    - + to 0
    - 0 to -
  - A transition marks a 1, no transition marks a 0
  - The 4B/5B translation ensures that every chunk of 5 symbols has at least two transition so the average voltage is roughly 0V
    - E.g input 0000 with no transitions becomes 11110 with 4 transitions
  
  ##### Example:
  
  ![e3f60dc3.png](:storage\\c38f79ce-f14b-4bec-8ef3-b6c06b5de4a3\\e3f60dc3.png)
  
  ##### Baud rate
  - A physical representation is called a symbol
  - Symbols need to be binary
  - Need not represent a whole number of bits
  - The baud rate is the number of symbols per second
  - Example
    - 100Mb/s Ethernet runs up to 31.25MHz for a symbol rate of 125MBaud
    - All 1s output (IDLE) is four transitions per cycle
      - - to 0
      - 0 to +
      - + to 0
      - 0 to -
    - 4 symbols/cycle Ã 31.25MHz = 125MBaud
    - This is a symbol rate of 125MBaud for a data rate of 100Mb/s
      - 80% efficient or 1 physical symbol is 4/5 = 0.8 bits
  
  #### Physical encodings of bits on a 1Gb/s Ethernet
  - For Gigabit Ethernet 1000Base-T: 8 bits become 4x3 physical bits in a continuously changing encoding (not a table lookup)
  - Each 3 bit chunk is encoded using transitions between 5 levels (PAM-5)
  - Over all four pairs in the cable simultaneously, in both directions over all pairs
  - 10Gb Ethernet uses a PAM-16 over a very complicated coding

  ## Analogue
  - Before digital networks were common, the physical layer of choice was an acoustic modem, using the existing telephone network
  - This used **MO**dulation and **DEM**odulation to convert bits into acoustic symbols (i.e. sounds)
  - The early Internet (Arpanet) ran over the existing analogue telephone network
  
  ---
  
  ## ADSL
  - After  analogue, public telephone systems started to support purely digital networks
  - Asymmetrical Subscriber line (ADSL) is a popular method of delivery to the home
  - Analogue modems are limited to 56Kb/s, the maximum speed available from a standard analogue telephone line apart from a 3KHz chunk centred on the human voice are filtered and thrown away
  - The telephone wire:
    - While only origionally specified to be capable of sending vioce
    - Is capable of more, ADSL tries to take advantage of this
  - The data rate you get depends on the length of the copper loop connectinf you to the telephone exchange
    - The longer it is the harder it is to get a clean signal down it
  - It tops at 24Mb/s, dropping to 2Mb/s at the longest reach
  - It is asymmetric:
    - It divides the available bandwidth unequally
      - E.g 24Mb/s downstream (towards the user) and 2Mb/s upstream (towards the Internet)
      - This is what most users want, you end up downloading a lot more than you upload
  
  ---
  
  ## Last mile problem
  - How to bridge the gap between the local telephone exchange and the final user
  - Also called the first mile problem
  
  ---
  
  ## Fibre
  - Optical fibre is not subject to electrical interference like copper wires
  - Can carry huge (terabits is possible) datarates
  - Expensive to install as it requires roads to be dug up
  
  ### Fibre hybrid
  - We would like Fibre to the building/business (FTTB)
    - Fibre to the premises (FTTP)
      - Where fiber comes to a multi occupancy building
    - Fibre to the home (FTTH)
      - Where fibres come to individual occupancies
  - Currently the popular solution is to lay new Fibre to the stree cabinet (FTTC) and then use a DSL over the existing copper wire (the copper loop) to the home
  - VDSL2 is used on the copper from the cabinet to the home:
    - With up to an 80Mb/s downlink
  - The distance you live from the cabinet now governs what speed you get
  - ADSL uses the copper loop to the home
  - This can be many kms, making the maximum achievable bandwidth about 24Mb/s
  - The FTTC hybrid represent the current cost effective way of geting decent bandwidth to hte home
  - FTTH/P is sometimes marketed as "full fibre"
  - Other developments
    - Fibre to the distribution point (FTTdp)
      - Lays new fibre from the cabinet to the distribution point where the cable bundle splits into individual wires to the premises
      - A box at the distribution point converts the optical signal to an electrical  signal along the final copper loop to the premises
      - This reduces the length of the copper loops (up to 500m)
      - Offers speeds up to 1Gb/s, but trypically a few 100s of Mbs/s
      - Need frequencies that are sufficiently highy that tehy will interfere with FM broadcasts
        - Need to take care over power limitations

  ## Cable TV
  - The cable TV system is also ble to deliver Internet connectivity
  - Newer installations are full fibre
    - But there are also a lot of fibre/copper hybrids
    - With fibre to cabinets and then copper to the home
  - However, the copper wires used is good(ish) quality coaxial cable that is well screened against interference and crosstalk
    - So their data rates are much higher

  ## Wireless
  - Wireless hardware is overseen by national and international bodies
  - One wireless sustem can affect another hundreds or thousands of miles away
    - There must be some cooperation
    - So some wireless systems are only allowed with very low power (e.g WI-Fi)
  - Eurome has the European Telecommunication Standard Institute (ETSI)
  - USA has the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)
  - Such bodies manage the radio spectrum
    - Allocate various frequencies to various puroposes
    - Ensuring Minimal interference between the competing concerns for parts of the spectrum
  
  ### Wi-Fi
  - The IEEE 802.11 group of standards deal with "wireless Ethernet"
    - More commonly known a Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi)
  - In principle it is much like CSMA/CD over wireless, but with come extra problems unique to wireless
  - Signal from multiple networks can interfere
    - Not just the hosts within one network
  - Wireless networks generally have fairly high error ratees due to interference from electronically noisy environments, signal refelctions, etc.
  - The bandwidth achievable is dependent on the circumstances of the environment
  - Wireless networks generate interference themselves which must be controlled so not to be too annoying to other people
  
  ### Wireless problems
  - In IEEE 802.11, the allowed power of transmission is generally kept quite low by the standards bodies to minimise interference
    - A typical laptop will transmit at about 32mW and can reade a signal as low as 0.00000001mW
  - A typical digita TV mast transmits at 100kW
    - Thus the range achievable by Wi-Fi is often quite limited (deliberately)
    - Limited range can cause complications
  
  #### The hidden host problem:
  ![29a7c005.png](:storage\\c38f79ce-f14b-4bec-8ef3-b6c06b5de4a3\\29a7c005.png)
  
  - Host A and B can "see" each other
  - B and C can see each other
  - A cannot see C
    - So A cannot tell if its packets that are being sent to B are colliding with the packets being sent from C to B
  - In reality the ranges will not be circular as it is affected by the environment
  - The limited ranges mean that CSMA/CD will not work for wireless
  - CSMA/CD relies on everyone's signals being visible to everyone
  
  #### Security problems
  - As packets are proadcast, wireless networks are intrinsically insecure
    - Extra effort must be taken over security and authentication
  - War Driving is driving with your laptop until you find an unsecured wireless signal
    - This gives you free access to the Internet
    - It is illegal in the UK and elsewhere
  
  ### Wireless 802.11
  - There are several parts to the 802.11 standard, these are often branded:
    - Wi-Fi 6 -> 802.11ax
    - Wi-Fi 5 -> 802.11ac
    - Wi-Fi 4 -> 802.11n
    - Wi-Fi 3 -> 802.11g
    - Wi-Fi 2 -> 802.11a
    - Wi-Fi 1 -> 802.11b
    - Other parts of 802.11 like 11c, 11d, 11e, 11f, 11h, 11i which deal with things like power management, wuality of service and authentication and so on
  - The origional standard specified signalling rates of up to 2Mb/s
    - Up to 100m indoors and 300m outdoors
    - There was an infa-red mode as well as radio mode
      - This was not widely implemented
    - 802.11b extended this rate to 5.5Mb/s and 11Mb/s
  - They used unlicensed 2.4Ghz waveband
    - This means you do not need to get a licens to use that frequence at low power
    - This frequency that was otherwise unusable commercially and is subject to interference from microwave ovens and other things
    - The frequency fell within the capabilities of low power chips that were buildable at the time
  
  |IEEE Standard|Speed   |Frequency        |
  |-------------|--------|-----------------|
  |802.11a      |54Mb/s  |5GHz             |
  |802.11g      |54Mb/s  |2.4GHz           |
  |802.11n      |150Mb/s |2.4GHz/5GHz      |
  |802.11ac     |867Mb/s |5GHz             |
  |802.11ad     |6.75Gb/s|2.4GHz/5GHz/60GHz|
  |802.11ax     |14Gb/s  |2.4GHz/5GHz      |
  |802.11ay     |40Gb/s  |60GHz            |
  
  - Each will fall back to previous standards to maintain compatability with earlier devices
    - E.g 60GHz will go through walls, so 11ad will dall back to 11ac if you move to the next room
  - 802.11 hardware is branded as "Wi-Fi" which is actually a certificate of interopability given to manufaturers whose equiptment demonstatrably works with other manufacturersâ
    - Administered by the Wi-Fi Alliance, a consortium of interested companies
  - The bits in 802.11 are not simply transmitted directly
    - There is a lot of environmetal interference to overcome
    - Instead the signal is spread over many frequencies using variaty of techniques collectively called spread spectrum
  - For wifi, the allocated frequency band (2.4GHz) is split into overlapping 22MHz channels each centred on specified frequencies
  
  |Channel|GHz  |
  |-------|-----|
  |1      |2.412|
  |2      |2.417|
  |3      |2.422|
  |4      |2.427|
  |5      |2.432|
  |6      |2.437|
  |7      |4.422|
  |8      |4.447|
  |9      |4.452|
  |10     |4.457|
  |11     |4.462|
  |12     |4.467|
  |13     |4.472|
  |14     |4.484|
  
  - Each of these are generally 5MHz appart
    - So neighbouring channels overlap
      - As they are 22MHz wide
      - These interfere
    - This means that you need to take care which channels you choose
  - Recommendation when selecting channels:
    - Seperate channels by at least 2 to reduce interference
      - E.g 1 and 4
    - Seperate channes by 4 to have no interference
      - E.g 1 and 6
    - This means that we have 3 non-interfering co-located networks
      - 1, 6 and 11
  - Seperating networks physically gives more leeway:
    - Seperate by 1 is the networks are 40m apart
      - E.g 1 and 3
    - You can uses adjacent channels at 100m apart
      - E.g 1 and 2
    - Channels can be reused when networks are sufficiently sperated
  
  ![6547a305.png](:storage\\c38f79ce-f14b-4bec-8ef3-b6c06b5de4a3\\6547a305.png)
  
  - More subtle channel allocations allow a little overlap:
    - E.g 1 and 3
    - These have a little interference
    - But a greater overall aggregate bandwidth
  
  #### CSMA/CA
  - 802.11 uses carrier sense, multiple access, collision avoidance 
    - CSMA/CA
  - Similar to CSMA/CD in Ethernet, but with a big difference:
    - Carrier sense: To deal with with the common case of non-hidden hosts:
      - First listen for a signal
      - If free send packet
      - If busy, wait until the end of the transmission and then enter a contention period
        - Wait a random period
    - Go back to carrier sense
  - Waiting for the contention period is the collision aviodance
    - A random wair means that several hosts waiting to transmit are unlikely to all start transmitting simultaneously
    - We are trying to avoid a collision in advance rather than detect it after the fact
    - But collision avoidance does not guarentee no collisions:
      - Particularly with hidden hosts
  - On the successful receipt of a packet, a host will broadcast an acknowledgement (ACK) packet
  - This is just a packet to inform the sender that everything well and there was no collision or other loss
  - If a sender never gets the ACK it will resend, staring from the collision avoidance again
  - Measurements have ound that a typical loss rate around 30%
  - The ACK is visible to everyone in the range of the destination, this gives extra indication when a transmission has finished

  **Why use collision avoidamce over collision detection?**
  - Clearly the contention period means that the latency in transmission for CA is higher 
  - But collisions in wireless can be hard to detect
  - With Ethernet detecting another host's signal on the wire is easy as the power of its signal is roughly the same as yours
  - Detecting another host's radio signal can be very difficult
    - It can be a tiny fraction of the power of yours
    - Your signal will drown out the colliding signal making it undetectable
    - Another destination might be transmitting quite powerfully, but its signal can be very small by the time it reaches you
  
  #### RTS/CTS handshaking
  This helps with the visibility problem
  
  1. Before sending a data packe the source A can send a **request to send** (RTS) packet to B
  2. If the destination B is happy (it is not already recieving from another host that A cannot see) it responts with a **clear to send packet** (CTS). Every host within the range of the destination will see the CTS and so know not to send packets themselves
  3. The RTS and CST contain the length of the desired transmission so other hosts know how long they have to wait
  4. Similarly, the final ACK is visible to everyone
  5. Then C ca7n send its oen RTS

  - This means there is even more latency overhead before data starts to be transmitted
  - RTS/CTS can be switched off or on as required
    - RTS/CTS always on: good for large or busy networks
    - RTS/CTS never on: Good for small or lightly loaded netwokrs where every gost can see all other hosts
    - RTS/CTS for large packets only: a compromise that reduces the relatively large overhead for small packets
  
  #### Wireless rates
  - Although 802.11b is nominally 11Mb/s and 802.11g is nominally 54Mb/s
    - Remember these are signalling rates not data rates
  - The signalling rate is the raw bit rate over the airwaves
    - A lot of that is consumed in overheads
  - Realistically 802.11b gives about 3 to 4Mb/s and 802.11g gives about 20Mb/s
  - Some of the later 802.11 standards improve speeds by reducing overheads
    - As well as using better encoding
  
  #### Ad-Hoc or Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS)
  - While the use of access points is common, it is not the only way to set up a wireless network
  - 802.11 can be arranged in point-to-point networks
  - Heach host communicates directly with each other without an access point
  
  ![ea5fd949.png](:storage\\c38f79ce-f14b-4bec-8ef3-b6c06b5de4a3\\ea5fd949.png)
  
  #### Basic Service Set (BSS)
  - Where a central hub (access hub) relays traffic between hosts
  - More expensive to set up 
    - You have to buy an access point
  - Covers a larger area
  - Also the access point can connect into a wired network and to the rest of the Internet
  
  ![bc6a701a.png](:storage\\c38f79ce-f14b-4bec-8ef3-b6c06b5de4a3\\bc6a701a.png)
  
  #### Extended Service Set (ESS)
  - Connects several APs by a wired network
  - This allows hosts to roam and they can be configured to handoff automatically between APs if the required authentication ifastructure is setup in the APs
  - An ESS can cover an area as large as you like

  #### Wireless security
  - Wireless packets are readable by anyone in the neighbourhood
    - So security is essential
  - Origional 802.11 employed the Wired Equivelent Privacy (WEP) encryption scheme
  - Both ends of a communucatuib share a secret key that is used to encrypt traffic between them
  - WEP is now easily breakable:
    - After collecting a modest amount of traffic the syste2m can be broken
  - As can its successor, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)
  - There are two ways to set up authentication WPA-Personal and WPA-Enterprise
  - **WPA-Personal**
    - Also called WPA-PSK (pre-shared key)
    - Where an access point has a secret key
    - A host authenticated directly with the access point using the secret key
  - **WPA-Enterprise**
    - 802.11x
    - Rquires a seperate authentication server that the AP will contact
      - Typically a RADIUS server
    - More difficult to manage
    - Allows roeaming acress an extended service set
    - Also roaming across institutions using hierachical RADIUS server
  - We usually find:
    - BSS using WPA-PSK
    - ESS using WPA-Enterprise
    - But either can use either
  - WPA-PSK uses a security key usually derived from a password for ease of use
    - The password can be communicated off-line
    - Everyone on tohe network shares the same key/password
      - Authentication is done in the AP
  
  ![7ff7c96f.png](:storage\\c38f79ce-f14b-4bec-8ef3-b6c06b5de4a3\\7ff7c96f.png)
  
  ![3f6657c3.png](:storage\\c38f79ce-f14b-4bec-8ef3-b6c06b5de4a3\\3f6657c3.png)
  
  - For WPA-Enterprise each user has their own key/password
    - Authentication is done in the server on both the username and the password
  
  ##### WPS
  - Some APs have Wi-Fi Protected Setups (WPS), a simplified way of setting up WPA/WPA2 security
  - Designed for those who find typing a password too challenging
  - It is seriously broken and should be dissabled on your AP
  
  #### Frame layout for Wi-Fi
  - This is the same as for Ethernet
  - In particular it uses the same format MAC addresses
    - This alloes for the transparent mixing of Wi-Fi and Ethernet in a single network
  - An access point con pass on a Wi-Fi frame unchanged to an Ethernet frame unchanged to an Ethernet or visa versa
  
  ### Other wireless
  - Many other wireless networks exist
    - From local to wide-area
  - Bluetooth gives short range point-to-point communication
    - Just two hosts in the network
    - Range of 10m
    - Yses 2.4Ghz band
    - Not really designed to run the internet protocol
      - But it can by layering a suitable protocol
      - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a non-backwards-compatable evolution designed to reduce power consumption
    - IEEE 802.16 Wireless Man standard
      - For metropolitan area wireless
    - 802.22 Mobile wireless MAN
    - 802.20 Mobile broadband wireless access
    - Etc
  - Celular networks
     - Used by mobile phones
     - First important digital system was Global system for Mobile Communication (GSM)
     - Retrospectively named 2G
     - Rates of 9.6Kb/s to 14.4Kb/s
     - Hight Speed Circuit Switched Data (HSCSD) takes this up to 57.6Kb/s
     - General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), packet based, up to 171.2Kb/s
       - Uses several GSM channels 
     - Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) uses better encoding to get up to 384Kb/s
     - High-speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) ups this to 42.2Mb/s
     - Evolved High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA+) will do 168Mb/s
     - 4G
       - Uses Long Term Evolution (LTE) to promise 300Mb/s
       - Marketing as "4G" it origionally did not meet the proposed standard as it did not satisfy the proposed technical specification of a 4G system
       - In particular, a 4G network should support 1Gb/s (for a stationary host)
       - The ITU (who say what â4Gâ is supposed to mean) actually gave in to commerce and retroactively changed the definition of 4G to allow for LTE
     - LTE
       - This is data traffic only, does not have a voice channel
       - Currently LTE systems that want to make a voice call drop back to 3G
       - Just being introduced is voice over LTE (VoLTE) using a suitable digital encoding of sound
     - 5G
       - It uses the available spectrum much more effieicently than 4G
       - Employs frequencies up to 86GHz (LTE uses up to 6GHz)
       - Projections indicate users connected to a base station will share:
         - 20Gb/s download
         - 10Gb/s upload
       - A base station will sipport "millions" of devices per square mile
       - Devices can vonnect moving at 500Km/h
       - Latencies will be 1ms compared to the 20ms of LTE
       - Curent problems
         - 5G chipset currently suck a lot of power
         - Need to build a lot of base stations
         - Fighting amongst pgone companies ove radio spectrum
     - 6G
       - Targets 100Gb/s using 100GHz to 1THz frequencies
   - Satellite
     - Can be used outside of well-connected urban areas
     - Satelites can be very expensive to deploy and run
     - Can have high latency
       - About 1/10 of a second
     - Cover a large area with a resonably good bandwidth
     - They are good for remote and undeveloped areas with no other local infrastructure
     - There are two main variants:
       - One way satellite
       - Two wat satellite
     - **One way satellite**
       - Employs the usual asymmetry
       - Data from the home travels by telephone wire
       - Data towards the home travels through satellite connection
     - **Two way satellite**
       - Satellite contections both ways
       - More expensive equiptment in the home
       - No reliance on telephone network
