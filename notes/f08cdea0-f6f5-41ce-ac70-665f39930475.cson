  # Developing good scripts
  
  ## Properties of good scripts
  - A script should run without errors.
  - It should perform the task for which it is intended.
  - Program logic is clearly defined and apparent.
  - A script does not do unnecessary work.
  - Scripts should be reusable.

  ## Structure
  When creating a new script you should ask yourself these questions:
  - Will I be needing any information from the user or from the userâ€™s environment?
  - How will i store the information?
  - Are there any files that need to be created?
  - Where and with which permissions and ownerships?
  - What commands will I use?
  - When using the script on different systems, do all these systems have these commands in the required versions?
  - Does the user need notification?
    - When?
    - Why?
